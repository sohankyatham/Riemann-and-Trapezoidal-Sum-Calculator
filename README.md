# Riemann-and-Trapezoidal-Sum-Calculator
The Riemann and Trapezoidal Sum Calculator is a Python project designed to estimate the area under a curve using numerical integration techniques. Leveraging methods such as Riemann Sums (LRAM & RRAM) or the Trapezoidal Rule, the calculator approximates the integral of a given function. With an intuitive user interface, users input x and f(x) values and select the desired approximation method. Whether it's Left Riemann Sum (LRAM), Right Riemann Sum (RRAM), or the Trapezoidal Sum, users can visualize the approximation process and obtain the sum of the area under the curve.

Key features of the calculator include calculation and visualization of the function and corresponding approximation shapes, export and clear options for enhanced user experience, and menu bar functionality for convenient access to essential features. Users can export the graph as an image file (PNG, JPEG) and clear the entered data and graph for new calculations. The Riemann and Trapezoidal Sum Calculator serves as a valuable tool for students, educators, and professionals engaged in mathematical computations and applications, contributing to better understanding and application of mathematical concepts. Future updates may include additional approximation methods, improved visualization options, and enhanced user interactivity to broaden the calculator's functionality and usability.
